      "description": "Via Dolorosa is a road in the old city of Jerusalem, a path where Jesus was lead in agony, carrying the crucifixion Cross. There are a total of 14 stations along this path, based on events that occurred on the way to the Golgotha hill, the site of the crucifixion. At Holyland, the entire 14 steps are depicted to give one an overview of the suffering our Saviour went through for us. This experience allows one to refine their journey with Him and see in which part of the 14 steps they still are at. This journey requires intense reflection for anyone who really desires to have an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ and change their lives for the better.",

You cannot separate the Bible and Israel. They are one unit. Join us this year and remember the world revolves around Jerusalem. It is not like any other city in the world. Jerusalem is a fruitful land. It was in Jerusalem the last supper took place, it was in Jerusalem that Judas betrayed Jesus, it was at the outskirts of Jerusalem that Jesus Christ was crucified. The ultimate sacrifice was done and humanity saved. It is indeed a good year. For more information email israeltrip@impactforchristsa.com",
